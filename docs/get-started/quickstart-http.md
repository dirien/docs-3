# Quick-start: Expose a local HTTP server with a public IP

The easiest way to get started is with `inletsctl` which will create a public host for us on DigitalOcean and then configure the inlets-server automatically.

## Get inletsctl and `inlets`

```bash
# Remove `sudo to install to the local folder
curl -sLSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/inlets/inletsctl/master/get.sh | sudo sh

sudo inletsctl download
```

## Start a Python HTTP fileserver

The default port is 8000. Careful where you run this command because it will serve the current working folder to the Internet.

```bash
export STORE=/tmp/store/

mkdir -p $STORE
cd $STORE
echo "Hi" > hello-inlets.txt
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

## Create the exit-server on DigitalOcean

Now create an exit-server using inletsctl to automate the creation of the public host and the installation of the inlets server component:

```bash
inletsctl create --provider digitalocean \
  --region lon1 \
  --access-token-file ~/digitalocean-api
```

Run the command given for `inlets client` to connect to the server.

```bash
export UPSTREAM=http://127.0.0.1:8000
inlets client --remote "ws://142.93.33.12:8080" \
  --token "GhdoqT9NfZWbSlW0jHEQHcBPpC9Krv9xPxURdGrM9R3yXOwl7o6H2Pam3TnkMGNx" \
  --upstream $UPSTREAM
```

## Access your public service

You can now access the Python HTTP server by going to the IP address given, i.e. `http://142.93.33.12`.

Finally feel free to run `inletsctl delete` with the command given to you.

```bash
inletsctl delete --provider digitalocean --id "179755668"
```

## Wrapping up

In this tutorial we automated the cloud host using inletsctl, it provisioned a server using an API token from DigitalOcean and then we started the tunnel manually.

![Webhooks example](../images/webhooks.png)

There are many reasons that you may want to get incoming Internet access to your services either for development, or for production use. Above is an example of a webhook receiver, where the public IP is shared with GitHub. For this example, if your local HTTP port was `3000`, you would simply alter the `--upstream` flag from `8000` to `3000`.

If you would like to add TLS encryption to the tunnel then you can do this manually using a tutorial by Alex Ellis. You can either log into the cloud host using `ssh` and configure it, or use an alternative approach.

Add TLS manually: [HTTPS for your local endpoints with inlets and Caddy](https://blog.alexellis.io/https-inlets-local-endpoints/)

The easier alternative is to use [inlets PRO](https://inlets.dev) which has built-in TLS and can allow your computer to obtain a TLS certificate using a reverse proxy like Caddy, Nginx (with cert-bot) or Traefik.
