# Quick-start: Expose a local HTTP server with a Let's Encrypt certificate

The easiest way to get started is with `inletsctl` which will create a public host for us on DigitalOcean and then configure the inlets-server automatically.

## Get inletsctl and `inlets`

```bash
# Remove `sudo to install to the local folder
curl -sLSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/inlets/inletsctl/master/get.sh | sudo sh

sudo inletsctl download --pro
```

## Start a Python HTTP fileserver

The default port is 8000. Careful where you run this command because it will serve the current working folder to the Internet.

```bash
export STORE=/tmp/store/

mkdir -p $STORE
cd $STORE
echo "Hi" > hello-inlets.txt
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

## Create the exit-server on DigitalOcean

Now create an exit-server using inletsctl to automate the creation of the public host and the installation of the inlets server component:

```bash
inletsctl create --provider digitalocean \
  --region lon1 \
  --access-token-file ~/digitalocean-api
```

Note down the `--url` and `--token`, mine are as follows:

* `--url "wss://178.62.100.112:8123/connect"`
* `--token "4moSFBzB197ooqSoNpKsrJtEkladjJKwnCV6n42GF8EYa07HZjRXzoBbuTRIMPEU"`

## Customise the exit-server with your domain

By default inletsctl provisions servers for TCP tunnel servers. We'll log in and update it to a HTTP tunnel server. In the future, this may be integrated into inletsctl for us.

Create a DNS A record with the IP address that you received from DigitalOcean.

* `178.62.100.112` -> `web.example.com`

You'll also get an email with the root password, or you can look it up in your dashboard.

Log in over SSH:

```bash
ssh root@web.example.com
```

Update inlets PRO:

```bash
curl -sLSf https://github.com/inlets/inlets-pro/releases/download/0.8.3/inlets-pro -o inlets-pro
chmod +x inlets-pro
sudo systemctl stop inlets-pro
sudo mv inlets-pro /usr/local/bin/
```

Edit `/etc/systemd/system/inlets-pro.service`

```
[Unit]
Description=inlets PRO TCP server
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
Restart=always
RestartSec=2
StartLimitInterval=0
EnvironmentFile=/etc/default/inlets-pro
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/inlets-pro tcp server --auto-tls --auto-tls-san="${IP}" --token="${AUTHTOKEN}"

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Change it so that it includes the domain name you just created. This will cause the exit-server to obtain a TLS certificate from Let's Encrypt:

```
[Unit]
Description=inlets PRO HTTP server
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
Restart=always
RestartSec=2
StartLimitInterval=0
EnvironmentFile=/etc/default/inlets-pro
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/inlets-pro http server --auto-tls --auto-tls-san="${IP}" --token="${AUTHTOKEN}" --letsencrypt-domain web.example.com --letsencrypt-email contact@o6s.io

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

We changed the following:

* We changed the `Description` to `inlets PRO HTTP server`
* `inlets-pro http server` changed from `tcp server` to enable HTTP tunnels
* We added `--letsencrypt-domain` and `--letsencrypt-email`

Now restart the tunnel server and check its logs:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload && \
  sudo systemctl restart inlets-pro && \
sudo journalctl -u inlets-pro -f
```

You should see that everything worked:

```bash

```

## Connect your client

Now use the token and url you received in the previous step to connect.

```bash
inlets-pro http client \
 --url "wss://178.62.100.112:8123" \
 --token "4moSFBzB197ooqSoNpKsrJtEkladjJKwnCV6n42GF8EYa07HZjRXzoBbuTRIMPEU" \
 --upstream web.example.com=http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

You can provide more than one `--upstream` if you like, but you will also need a corresponding `--letsencrypt-domain` flag.

So, the server would have:

```
--letsencrypt-domain grafana.example.com \
  --letsencrypt-domain prometheus.example.com
```

The above would provision two separate TLS certificates, they do not strictly need to be part of the same top-level domain.

And the client would have two entries for the `--upstream` value.

```
--upstream grafana.example.come=http://127.0.0.1:3000,prometheus.example.come=http://127.0.0.1:9090
```

Or you could use two separate clients, each of which provides one of the upstream endpoints.

If you need more than a few separate TLS certificates, you may want to see the note at the end of the tutorial about using your own reverse proxy and a wildcard TLS certificate instead.

## Access your public service

You can now access the Python HTTP server by going to the domain name you created earlier.

![HTTPS endpoint with a valid certificate](../images/secure-http.png)

From here, you can keep your tunnel server and re-connect the same service to it, or disconnect and change the service you want to expose by changing the `--upstream` URL. You can also enter the IP address or a hostname of another computer on your network, for instance: `--upstream web.example.com=http://192.168.0.10:3000`.

Finally feel free to run `inletsctl delete` with the command given to you.

```bash
inletsctl delete --provider digitalocean --id "179755668"
```

## Wrapping up

In this tutorial we automated the cloud host using inletsctl, it provisioned a server using an API token from DigitalOcean and then we started the tunnel manually.

![Webhooks example](../images/webhooks.png)

There are many reasons that you may want to get incoming Internet access to your services either for development, or for production use. Above is an example of a webhook receiver, where the public IP is shared with GitHub. For this example, if your local HTTP port was `3000`, you would simply alter the `--upstream` flag from `8000` to `3000`.

An alternative to having inlets PRO's HTTP functionality terminate TLS for you, is to use the TCP mode, and forward ports 80 and 443 to a local reverse proxy such as Nginx running on your client's network.
